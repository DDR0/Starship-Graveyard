all compontents will be created with the same parameters
index-will state the broad type of component it is
style-is the way it goes about its main purpose
mod-is the model it covers more fine details like how it is effected by damage
index, style and mod will become more clear when we get multiple components created
level-how good a component is how much damage a weapon does etc.
durability-is the total health of the component

next is some basic variables for the component
probably the only thing that needs explanation here is the rank system
rank is used to say how much of the component is used by an action these are explained in more detail in the comments

attributes will be a list of characteristics that the comp has

server contains vars and functions that will be only on the server
my original idea was to have the a complete version of the comp on the server that would execute the actions
than a copy of it would be made the copies server would be set to null and it would be sent to the client
I don't like this that much any more so I may do something different

findFunction takes a string and returns a function ie takes 'move' and returns the basic move function for engines

the startTarget and target functions are used to target in the case of the engine they set the direction of the thrust
startTarget is bound to a buttonListener and amoung other things bind target to a mouseListener on the map
